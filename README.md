<h2>Search Algorithms</h2>

<h3>Linear Search</h3>
The Linear Search algorithm searches through a list linearly. When it encounters the target value, it returns the index.

<h3>Binary Search</h3>
The Binary Search algorithm searches through a sorted list. It keeps track of lower and upper limits and narrows down the possible index positions of the target.

<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>

<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
The Bubble Sort algorithm repeatedly iterates through a list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements to order the list.

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
The Insertion Sort algorithm divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted section. Each element in the unsorted section is inserted at the appropriate location in the sorted section.

<h3>Selection Sort</h3>
The Selection Sort algorithm divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted section. The minimum value from the unsorted section is removed and added to the end of the sorted section.

<h3>Merge Sort</h3>
The Merge Sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that breaks up a list into its individual elements and reassembling the broken elements into an ordered list.
